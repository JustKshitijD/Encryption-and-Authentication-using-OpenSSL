RSA encryption: https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2019/cmsc414/projects/p3.pdf

We will assume that for a given set of users, the corresponding public/private key pair is locally
available
We will assume that only CBC mode is used.

CONF only: The email message is encrypted with a randomly generated secret message key (or session key)
using a symmetric block cipher algorithm. The message key is encrypted using the receiver’s public key
and pre-pended to the message. The [encrypted key, message] is then written into a file that can be sent
using traditional email.

EncryAlg is one of: des-ede3-cbc, aes-256-cbc

In this example we are using 256 bit AES (i.e. a 256 bit key). The
     * IV size for *most* modes is the same as the block size. For AES this
     * is 128 bits
During initialisation we will provide an EVP_CIPHER object. In this case we are using EVP_aes_256_cbc(), which uses the AES algorithm with a 256-bit key in CBC mode

Compile via: gcc CONF_encrypt.c -lcrypto


EKUb is the receiver’s RSA
public key

EKRa is the sender’s RSA private key

Ks is the session key (and any needed initialization vector, IVs), Kh is the hashing key (of length
equal to the hashing algorithm’s block size), EKRa is sender’s RSA private key and EKUb is receiver’s RSA
public key.

Ks is generated randomly and uses symmetric block cipher algo.

The UserNameListFile will contain a set of users, one per line. RSAKeySize is either 1024 or 2048.
For each user, randomly generate an RSA key pair and store private key and public key in user priv
keylen.txt and user pub keylen.txt respectively; where keylen is either 1024 or 2048.


implement the message
digest first, then try encryption with secret key, then try encryption with public/private key, etc

You can run ’man evp’, ’man rsa’, ’man pem’ for lots of additional
information.
Note: By default, the crypto functions produce binary output. You must choose base64 encoded output
format

cryptography includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and key derivation functions.

-in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard
           input if this option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a
           pass phrase will be prompted for.

 -out filename
           This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard
           output if this option is not specified. If any encryption options
           are set then a pass phrase will be prompted for. The output
           filename should not be the same as the input filename.

|-idea
   These options encrypt the private key with the specified cipher
   before outputting it.

To remove the pass phrase on an RSA private key:
	openssl rsa -in key.pem -out keyout.pem

	To encrypt a private key using triple DES:

	openssl rsa -in key.pem -des3 -out keyout.pem

	To convert a private key from PEM to DER format:

	openssl rsa -in key.pem -outform DER -out keyout.der

	To print out the components of a private key to standard output:

	openssl rsa -in key.pem -text -noout

	To just output the public part of a private key:

	openssl rsa -in key.pem -pubout -out pubkey.pem

	Output the public part of a private key in RSAPublicKey format:

	openssl rsa -in key.pem -RSAPublicKey_out -out pubkey.pem



rsautl:-
SYNOPSIS
       openssl rsautl [-in file] [-out file] [-inkey file] [-pubin] [-certin]
       [-sign] [-verify] [-encrypt] [-decrypt] [-pkcs] [-ssl] [-raw]
       [-hexdump] [-asn1parse]

COMMAND OPTIONS
       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read data from or standard
           input if this option is not specified.

       -out filename
           specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
           default.

       -inkey file
           the input key file, by default it should be an RSA private key.

       -pubin
           the input file is an RSA public key.

       -certin
           the input is a certificate containing an RSA public key.

       -sign
           sign the input data and output the signed result. This requires and
           RSA private key.

       -verify
           verify the input data and output the recovered data.

       -encrypt
           encrypt the input data using an RSA public key.

       -decrypt
           decrypt the input data using an RSA private key.       

-pkcs, -oaep, -ssl, -raw
           the padding to use: PKCS#1 v1.5 (the default), PKCS#1 OAEP, special
           padding used in SSL v2 backwards compatible handshakes, or no
           padding, respectively.  For signatures, only -pkcs and -raw can be
           used.

       -hexdump
           hex dump the output data.

       -asn1parse
           asn1parse the output data, this is useful when combined with the
           -verify option.

NOTES
       rsautl because it uses the RSA algorithm directly can only be used to
       sign or verify small pieces of data.

EXAMPLES
       Sign some data using a private key:

        openssl rsautl -sign -in file -inkey key.pem -out sig

       Recover the signed data

        openssl rsautl -verify -in sig -inkey key.pem




Recall, for example, the SHA256 hash function. For an input bitstring of any length N > 0, this function generates a fixed-length hash value of 256 bits; hence, this hash value does not reveal even the input bitstring’s length N, let alone the value of each bit in the string. 


STEPS for AUIN:
1) create "plaintext" using "create_plaintext.c". Plaintext lenth in [10,59].
2) run sha512_generate.py OR sha3-512_generate.py to create hash from "plaintext" and store in "hash". 
3) run "create_user_name_list_and_rsa_keys.py" to create users and rsa keys. 
4) Pick any of these users and use their keys. Edit "rsa_encrypt_hash.sh" to change private rsa key of sender. 
Run it to encrypt "hash" to give "rsa_encrypted_hash".
5) run "final_encryption.py" to append "rsa_encrypted_hash" and "plaintext", and output "final_enc"

6) Run "break_final_enc_for_decryption.py" to break final_enc into "rsa_encrypted_hash_RECV" and "plaintext_RECV" files
7) Run "create_hash_from_received_plaintext.py" to convert "plaintext_RECV" to proper "hash_RECV" using sender's public key
(If sha3-512(OR) is used, then edit a line here to say that we are using sha3-512. Also check that in "bash_encrypt_2.sh", proper "python sha3-512_generate.py" is used).

8) Run "rsa_decrypt_hash.sh" to get "hash_from_rsa" from "rsa_encrypted_hash_RECV" using public key of sender.
9) Run "final_compare.py", which reads  from "hash_RECV" and "hash_from_rsa" and declares success if both are equal 

 Run everything in encrypt using "bash_encrypt_2.sh"
